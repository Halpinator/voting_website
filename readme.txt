To run:
cd into the server file
run "npm start"

Open vote.html in your browser of choice (I used Chrome when developing)

server/data.json can be used to edit options and amount of votes

This website allows for as many poll options as needed (is not limited to 3)

Oversights:
Due to this being rushed I havent had time to implement polls by poll ids, they simply work by creating a new poll object. The website does however work as intended.
Node.js was used to create the server and Insomia was used to test it.
Currenty you can just go back to submit as many votes as you want, this would need to be corrected in a full version.
